IMPORTANT CONSUMER NOTICES
Changes/Cancellations - Most tickets, other than Basic Economy tickets or those for travel originating outside the United States, other than for travel between the United States and Mexico or the Caribbean, may be changed to a different itinerary, or cancelled and the value of the ticket retained so that it can be applied to a new ticket, without a change fee. Such change or cancellation must be made prior to the scheduled departure time. Travelers making changes will be responsible for the fare difference if the new itinerary has a higher fare than the original ticketed itinerary. Regarding non-refundable tickets, if the new itinerary has a lower fare than the original ticketed itinerary, changes can be made without charge, but the traveler is not entitled to any residual value. United may, in its sole discretion, provide partial or full residual credit under certain circumstances. A change fee may apply for changes or cancellations made to tickets for travel originating outside the United States, other than for travel between the United States and Mexico or the Caribbean.

Notice of Certain Terms - If you have purchased a restricted ticket, depending on the rules applicable to the fare paid, one or more restrictions including, but not limited to, the following may apply to your travel: (1) the ticket may not be refundable but can be exchanged for a fee for another restricted fare ticket meeting all the rules/restrictions of the original ticket (including the payment of any difference in fares); (2) a fee may apply for changing/canceling reservations; or (3) select tickets may not be eligible for refunds or changes even for a fee; (4) select tickets have no residual value and cannot be applied towards the purchase of future travel; or (5) travel may be restricted to specific flights and/ or times and a minimum and/or maximum stay may be required. United reserves the right to refuse carriage to any person who has acquired a ticket in violation of any United tariffs, rules, or regulations, or in violation of any applicable national, federal, state, or local law, order, regulation, or ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are entitled to a full refund if you cancel a ticket purchased at least a week prior to departure within 24 hours of purchase.

Notice of Boarding Times - For Domestic flights, customers must be at the boarding gate at least 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. For International flights, customers must be at the boarding gate at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure. The time limits provided by United in this Notice are minimum time requirements. Customer and baggage processing times may differ from airport to airport. Please visit united.com for information regarding airport-specific boarding times. It is the customer's responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time to complete check-in, baggage, and security screening processes within these minimum time limits. Please be sure to check flight information monitors for the correct boarding gate and the departure time of your flight. Failure to be at the boarding gate by the required time could result in the loss of your seat without compensation, regardless of whether you are already checked in or have a confirmed seat and boarding pass.

Advice to International Passengers on Carrier Liability - Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that international treaties known as the Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, including its amendments, may apply to the entire journey, including any portion thereof within a country. For such passengers, the treaty, including contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, governs, and may limit the liability of the Carrier in respect of death or injury to passengers, and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.

Notice - Overbooking of Flights - Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadlines, which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons, denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.

IMPORTANT CONSUMER NOTICES
Changes/Cancellations - Most tickets, other than Basic Economy tickets or those for travel originating outside the United States, other than for travel between the United States and Mexico or the Caribbean, may be changed to a different itinerary, or cancelled and the value of the ticket retained so that it can be applied to a new ticket, without a change fee. Such change or cancellation must be made prior to the scheduled departure time. Travelers making changes will be responsible for the fare difference if the new itinerary has a higher fare than the original ticketed itinerary. Regarding non-refundable tickets, if the new itinerary has a lower fare than the original ticketed itinerary, changes can be made without charge, but the traveler is not entitled to any residual value. United may, in its sole discretion, provide partial or full residual credit under certain circumstances. A change fee may apply for changes or cancellations made to tickets for travel originating outside the United States, other than for travel between the United States and Mexico or the Caribbean. Policies concerning your ability to make reservation changes and cancellations and any fees associated with such changes can be found at Important travel notices | United Airlines.

Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations - For domestic travel between points within the United States (except for domestic portions of international journeys), United's liability for loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of a customer's checked baggage is limited to $3,800 per ticketed customer unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid (not applicable to wheelchairs or other assistive devices). For such travel, United assumes no liability for high value, fragile, perishable, or otherwise excluded items; excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of valuable articles. Further information may be obtained from the carrier. For international travel governed by the Warsaw Convention (including the domestic portions of the trip), maximum liability is approximately 640 USD per bag for checked baggage, and 400 USD per passenger for unchecked baggage. For international travel governed by the Montreal Convention (including the domestic portions of the trip), maximum liability is 1,288 SDRs per passenger for baggage, whether checked or unchecked. For baggage lost, delayed, or damaged in connection with domestic travel, United requires that customers provide preliminary notice within 24 hours after arrival of the flight on which the baggage was or was to be transported and submit a written claim within 45 days of the flight. For baggage damaged or delayed in connection with most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys), the Montreal Convention and United require customers to provide carriers written notice as follows: (a) for damaged baggage, within seven days from the date of receipt of the damaged baggage; (b) for delayed baggage, within 21 days from the date the baggage should have been returned to the customer. Please refer to Rule 28 of United's Contract of Carriage for important information relating to baggage and other limitations of liability.

Notice of Incorporated Terms - Transportation is subject to the terms and conditions of United's Contract of Carriage, which are incorporated herein by reference. Incorporated terms may include, but are not limited to: 1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death of the customer, and for loss, damage, or delay of goods and baggage, including high value, fragile, perishable, or otherwise excluded items. 2. Claims restrictions, including time periods within which customers must file a claim or bring an action against the carrier. 3. Rights of the carrier to change terms of the contract. 4. Rules about reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry. 5. Rights of the carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of an alternate air carrier or aircraft, and rerouting. The full text of United's Contract of Carriage is available at united.com or you may request a copy at any United ticket counter. Passengers have the right, upon request at any location where United's tickets are sold within the United States, to receive free of charge by mail or other delivery service the full text of United's Contract of Carriage.

Notice of Certain Terms - If you have purchased a restricted ticket, depending on the rules applicable to the fare paid, one or more restrictions including, but not limited to, the following may apply to your travel: (1) the ticket may not be refundable but can be exchanged for a fee for another restricted fare ticket meeting all the rules/restrictions of the original ticket (including the payment of any difference in fares); (2) a fee may apply for changing/canceling reservations; or (3) select tickets may not be eligible for refunds or changes even for a fee; (4) select tickets have no residual value and cannot be applied towards the purchase of future travel; or (5) travel may be restricted to specific flights and/ or times and a minimum and/or maximum stay may be required. United reserves the right to refuse carriage to any person who has acquired a ticket in violation of any United tariffs, rules, or regulations, or in violation of any applicable national, federal, state, or local law, order, regulation, or ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are entitled to a full refund if you cancel a ticket purchased at least a week prior to departure within 24 hours of purchase.

Notice of Boarding Times - For Domestic flights, customers must be at the boarding gate at least 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. For International flights, customers must be at the boarding gate at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure. The time limits provided by United in this Notice are minimum time requirements. Customer and baggage processing times may differ from airport to airport. Please visit united.com for information regarding airport-specific boarding times. It is the customer's responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time to complete check-in, baggage, and security screening processes within these minimum time limits. Please be sure to check flight information monitors for the correct boarding gate and the departure time of your flight. Failure to be at the boarding gate by the required time could result in the loss of your seat without compensation, regardless of whether you are already checked in or have a confirmed seat and boarding pass.

Advice to International Passengers on Carrier Liability - Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that international treaties known as the Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, including its amendments, may apply to the entire journey, including any portion thereof within a country. For such passengers, the treaty, including contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, governs, and may limit the liability of the Carrier in respect of death or injury to passengers, and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.

Notice - Overbooking of Flights - Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadlines, which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons, denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.

ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a carrier’s own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.

Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier’s liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.

Conditions of Carriage

Air transportation on Delta and the Delta Connection® carriers is subject to Delta's conditions of carriage. They include terms governing for example:

• Limits on our liability for personal injury or death of passengers, and for loss, damage of delay of goods and baggage.
• Claim restrictions including time periods within which you must file a claim or bring action against us.
• Our right to change terms of the contract.
• Check-in requirements and other rules established when we may refuse carriage.
• Our rights and limits of our liability for delay or failure to perform service including schedule change, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.
• Our policy on overbooking flights, and your rights if we deny you boarding due to an oversold flight.

These terms are incorporated by reference into our contract with you. You may view these conditions of carriage on delta.com, or by requesting a copy from Delta.

You have received this email because you elected to receive your Electronic Ticket receipt sent to you via email. If you would like to take advantage of other Delta email programs featuring special fares, promotions, information and flight updates, please visit: delta.com/emailprograms or delta.com/notifications.

This document establishes the creation of your electronic EMD(S) in our computer systems. It does not constitute a document of carriage. Where this document is issued for transportation or services other than passenger air transportation, specific terms and conditions may apply. These terms and conditions may be provided separately or may be obtained from the issuing agent. 

Effective December 15, 2019, the Canada Air Passenger Protection Regulations may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Canada:

If you are denied boarding, your flight is cancelled or delayed for at least two hours, or your baggage is lost or damaged, you may be entitled to certain standards of treatment and compensation under the Air Passenger Protection Regulations. For more information about your passenger rights please contact your air carrier (www.delta.com/appr) or visit the Canadian Transportation Agency’s website.

Si l’embarquement vous est refusé, ou si votre vol est annulé ou retardé d’au moins deux heures ou si vos bagages sont perdus ou endommagés, vous pourriez avoir droit au titre du Règlement sur la protection des passagers aériens, à certains avantages au titre des normes de traitement applicables et à une indemnité. Pour de plus amples renseignements sur vos droits, veuillez communiquer avec votre transporteur aérien ( www.delta.com/appr) ou visiter le site Web de l’Office des transports du Canada.

IMPORTANT CONSUMER NOTICES
Changes/Cancellations - Most tickets, other than Basic Economy tickets or those for travel originating outside the United States, other than for travel between the United States and Mexico or the Caribbean, may be changed to a different itinerary, or cancelled and the value of the ticket retained so that it can be applied to a new ticket, without a change fee. Such change or cancellation must be made prior to the scheduled departure time. Travelers making changes will be responsible for the fare difference if the new itinerary has a higher fare than the original ticketed itinerary. Regarding non-refundable tickets, if the new itinerary has a lower fare than the original ticketed itinerary, changes can be made without charge, but the traveler is not entitled to any residual value. United may, in its sole discretion, provide partial or full residual credit under certain circumstances. A change fee may apply for changes or cancellations made to tickets for travel originating outside the United States, other than for travel between the United States and Mexico or the Caribbean. Policies concerning your ability to make reservation changes and cancellations and any fees associated with such changes can be found at Important travel notices | United Airlines.

Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations - For domestic travel between points within the United States (except for domestic portions of international journeys), United's liability for loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of a customer's checked baggage is limited to $3,800 per ticketed customer unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid (not applicable to wheelchairs or other assistive devices). For such travel, United assumes no liability for high value, fragile, perishable, or otherwise excluded items; excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of valuable articles. Further information may be obtained from the carrier. For international travel governed by the Warsaw Convention (including the domestic portions of the trip), maximum liability is approximately 640 USD per bag for checked baggage, and 400 USD per passenger for unchecked baggage. For international travel governed by the Montreal Convention (including the domestic portions of the trip), maximum liability is 1,288 SDRs per passenger for baggage, whether checked or unchecked. For baggage lost, delayed, or damaged in connection with domestic travel, United requires that customers provide preliminary notice within 24 hours after arrival of the flight on which the baggage was or was to be transported and submit a written claim within 45 days of the flight. For baggage damaged or delayed in connection with most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys), the Montreal Convention and United require customers to provide carriers written notice as follows: (a) for damaged baggage, within seven days from the date of receipt of the damaged baggage; (b) for delayed baggage, within 21 days from the date the baggage should have been returned to the customer. Please refer to Rule 28 of United's Contract of Carriage for important information relating to baggage and other limitations of liability.

Notice of Incorporated Terms - Transportation is subject to the terms and conditions of United's Contract of Carriage, which are incorporated herein by reference. Incorporated terms may include, but are not limited to: 1. Limits on liability for personal injury or death of the customer, and for loss, damage, or delay of goods and baggage, including high value, fragile, perishable, or otherwise excluded items. 2. Claims restrictions, including time periods within which customers must file a claim or bring an action against the carrier. 3. Rights of the carrier to change terms of the contract. 4. Rules about reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry. 5. Rights of the carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including schedule changes, substitution of an alternate air carrier or aircraft, and rerouting.

Passengers have the right, upon request at any location where United's tickets are sold within the United States, to receive free of charge by mail or other delivery service the full text of United's Contract of Carriage.

Notice of Certain Terms - If you have purchased a restricted ticket, depending on the rules applicable to the fare paid, one or more restrictions including, but not limited to, the following may apply to your travel: (1) the ticket may not be refundable but can be exchanged for a fee for another restricted fare ticket meeting all the rules/restrictions of the original ticket (including the payment of any difference in fares); (2) a fee may apply for changing/canceling reservations; or (3) select tickets may not be eligible for refunds or changes even for a fee; (4) select tickets have no residual value and cannot be applied towards the purchase of future travel; or (5) travel may be restricted to specific flights and/ or times and a minimum and/or maximum stay may be required. United reserves the right to refuse carriage to any person who has acquired a ticket in violation of any United tariffs, rules, or regulations, or in violation of any applicable national, federal, state, or local law, order, regulation, or ordinance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are entitled to a full refund if you cancel a ticket purchased at least a week prior to departure within 24 hours of purchase.

Notice of Boarding Times - For Domestic flights, customers must be at the boarding gate at least 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. For International flights, customers must be at the boarding gate at least 30 minutes prior to scheduled departure. The time limits provided by United in this Notice are minimum time requirements. Customer and baggage processing times may differ from airport to airport. Please visit united.com for information regarding airport-specific boarding times. It is the customer's responsibility to arrive at the airport with enough time to complete check-in, baggage, and security screening processes within these minimum time limits. Please be sure to check flight information monitors for the correct boarding gate and the departure time of your flight. Failure to be at the boarding gate by the required time could result in the loss of your seat without compensation, regardless of whether you are already checked in or have a confirmed seat and boarding pass.

ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY - Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a carrier's own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.

Notice - Overbooking of Flights - Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadlines, which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons, denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.

For such passengers, the treaty, including special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, governs and may limit the liability of JetBlue in respect of death or injury to passengers, and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage. If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability. Please refer to JetBlue's Contract of Carriage for additional information, including the limits of liability for services provided in the European Union.

NOTICE OF OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS
In the event that a flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, JetBlue will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with JetBlue's check-in deadlines, persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. Please refer to JetBlue's Contract of Carriage for the complete rules for the payment of compensation and JetBlue's boarding priorities (also available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations). Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.
